-Added displayUsers in Owner_Services to display the requiring fields for the project.
-Modified the entities a bit to correspond with the relationships between them.
-Test set the connection between the Virtual Studio and the Database.
-Created methods for update,delete,view and create Owner.


We need to understand and declare the relationships between the entities, as it makes a big difference in the
coding.

In our project. my implementation is described as follows:
-An owner can have many properties.
-A single property can be in need of many different repairs.
-A type of repair can be implemented on multiple properties.
